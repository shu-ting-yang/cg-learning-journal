This website is my long-term studio for psychology, visual storytelling, and technical growth.

## Working principles

- Capture ideas in short, clear notes.
- Turn passive input into applied decisions.
- Keep artifacts searchable, reusable, and easy to update.

## Explore the streams

<div class="link-grid">
  <a class="link-tile" href="{{ '/podcast-notes/' | relative_url }}">
    <h3>Podcast Notes</h3>
    <p>Applied takeaways from psychology podcasts.</p>

## Publishing rhythm

I update each stream independently, but the structure is shared across the whole site. This keeps the design consistent and the maintenance cost low as content grows.
