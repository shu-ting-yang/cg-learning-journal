### Why Normal only requires Model transform? Why not view transfrom & perspective transform?

 - Because our light is in world coordinate, we need to transform Normal to the same coordinate system used by light.
 - $n$ and $l$ are calculated together in Lambertian model.

### Misc: Website clean up

- Clean up template files. Migrate daily log from GitHub wiki to website.
  - add support for math in LaTex form as well.

  MathJax parses LaTeX math, but we have to tell it which delimiters (e.g. `$...$, \(...\), $$...$$, \[...\])` should trigger parsing.

  MathJax v2 supported `$ ... $` by default.

  MathJax v3 does not support `$ ... $` unless you explicitly configure it.
  ```html
    <script>
    window.MathJax = {
      tex: {
        inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\(', '\\)']],
        displayMath: [['$$', '$$'], ['\\[', '\\]']]
      }
    };
  </script>
  ```
