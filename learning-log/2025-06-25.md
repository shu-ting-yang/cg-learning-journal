## Mini renderer project

- start by learning OpenGL properly
- A shift of learning strategy - I need to actually learn it instead of shipping it without understanding what I am doing.
- study [opengl](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Hello-Triangle)
  - Understand Object, VBO, rendering pipeline, difference between tessellation shader and geometry shader.
    - Object is a description of some discrete state of the state machine (OpenGL)
    - VBO is an OpenGL buffer object storing vertex data (positions, colors, normals, texture coordinates, etc.).
      - Data is transferred from CPU (RAM) to GPU memory via glBufferData()
      - we can specify how frequent the data will be updated(GL_STATIC_DRAW, GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW, GL_STREAM_DRAW), and GPU will put this in the corresponding memory so that it can fetch the data efficiently
    - tessellation shader is used to add more vertices based on existing vertices, to create a more detailed/smoother result
    - geometry shader is used to add more vertices OUT OF existing vertices, for example the particle effect, and flame effect.
