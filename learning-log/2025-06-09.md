### gltf-viewer tutorial

[Link to tutorial](https://gltf-viewer-tutorial.gitlab.io/sdk/)

Cloned the repo from GitLab (gltf-viewer-tutorial/gltf-viewer).

Hit CMake version error. Resolved by updating cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5) to a newer version.

Built the project using helper bash functions: cmake_prepare; cmake_build; cmake_install.

Ran ./build/bin/gltf-viewer info, encountered Unable to open window runtime crash.

Fixed by debugging OpenGL context creation failure.

Encountered missing glDebugOutputCallback symbol.

Implemented the debug callback manually, confirmed fallback worked: [Debug Output] OpenGL context has no debug flag.

Confirmed OpenGL 4.1 context and viewer executable runs.
