## Mini renderer project

Mini renderer project is totally doable, but we need some workaround:
 - Metal(as well as Object-C)'s learning curve is too steep for me, too few study material, and even the official document is not beginner friendly.
 - XCode's vim is notoriously bad, I'll have to work with VSCode + Xcode.
 - Instead, we use OpenGl quickly build the foundation.
