### Why We Use $M^{-1T}$ for Normal Transformation

Chatting with Claude about transforming normals.

## The Core Problem

Normals must remain perpendicular to surfaces after transformation. If you just apply the same transformation matrix $M$ to normals, they can lose this perpendicular property.

## Visual Example

Let me show you with an example:

Imagine a simple 2D case:
- You have a horizontal line (surface)
- The normal to this line points straight up (vertical)
- Now you apply a transformation that stretches everything horizontally by factor 2, but keeps vertical unchanged

What happens?
- The line stays horizontal (just gets longer)
- If you apply the same transformation to the normal, it would still point straight up
- So far so good...

## The Problem with Non-Uniform Scaling

Now imagine you stretch horizontally by 2 and vertically by 0.5:
- A diagonal line gets transformed
- If you apply the same transformation to its normal, the normal is no longer perpendicular to the transformed line!

## The Mathematical Reason

The key insight is that normals live in what's called the "dual space." When you transform geometry, the relationship between a surface and its normal changes in the opposite way.

Think of it like this:
- If you stretch a surface in one direction, the normal should actually get "compressed" in that direction to maintain perpendicularity
- This "opposite" transformation is precisely what $M^{-1T}$ provides

## Why Specifically M^{-1T}?

Here's the mathematical proof:

1. A surface can be defined by equation: $\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{p} = d$ (where $\mathbf{n}$ is normal, $\mathbf{p}$ is point on surface)

2. After transforming points by $M$: $\mathbf{p'} = M\mathbf{p}$

3. We want the same relationship: $\mathbf{n'} \cdot \mathbf{p'} = d$

4. Substituting: $\mathbf{n'} \cdot (M\mathbf{p}) = \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{p}$

5. This means: $(\mathbf{n'}^T M)\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{n}^T \mathbf{p}$

6. Therefore: $\mathbf{n'}^T M = \mathbf{n}^T$

7. Taking transpose: $M^T \mathbf{n'} = \mathbf{n}$

8. Solving for $\mathbf{n'}$: $\mathbf{n'} = (M^T)^{-1} \mathbf{n} = (M^{-1})^T \mathbf{n}$

## Intuitive Summary

- Points transform "forward" with $M$
- Normals transform "backward" with $M^{-1T}$ 
- This ensures they remain perpendicular after transformation
- It's like they live in "opposite worlds" that balance each other out

The $M^{-1T}$ transformation essentially "undoes" the distortion that would break the perpendicular relationship.
