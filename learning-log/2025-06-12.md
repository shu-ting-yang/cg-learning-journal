### Start working on asset validation tool

- Today I reuse week 2's window creation, week 3's camera control & shader loading code to make the skeleton for week 4's project.
- I use Assimp to load gltf
- I plan to build an asset validation tool, which can read gltf file and show the model information.
- The code is working  
```
 ./AssetPipeline
Creating window...
OpenGL version: 4.1 Metal - 89.4
