### Wrap up for week 3

- See blog post for week 3: we discussed light attenuation for point lights, and the link between BRDF Lambertian model in RTR4 Chapter 9.3 and lighting model in Chapter 5.2

- The code is still WIP, for now only directional light is being used.

- We plan to provide switch for different lighting model.
