### Toggle light/dark theme

- Today I mainly worked on web light/dark theme toggling

- Reference web layout style is from "the book of shader".

- Also I detached the github repo from the origanl forked one, just to maintain the cleaness of self's repo. The License remains the same.

- And for the CG project, I removed broken imgui git submodule tracking. And I add include path for Assimp - Homebrew has its corresponding formula, so we can directly include it in the CMakeFilelist.
