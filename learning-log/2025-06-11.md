### Buffer objects

Trying to understand the code from [gltf viewer tutorial](https://gltf-viewer-tutorial.gitlab.io/initialization/)
```cpp
GLuint bufferObject = 0; // 0 represents a "null" buffer object, it does not exist yet
glGenBuffers(1, &bufferObject); // Ask opengl to reserve an identifier for our buffer object and store it in bufferObject.
// At this point we should have bufferObject > 0.
// We generally don't test for that, if it happens our program is likely to fail anyway.
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, bufferObject); // A buffer must be bound to be used
glBufferStorage(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, data.size(), data.data(), 0); // Assuming data is a std::vector containing some data
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0); // Generally a good idea to cleanup the binding point after
```

```cpp
GLuint bufferObject = 0;
```
This declares a variable to hold a buffer object identifier. In OpenGL, buffer objects are referenced by unsigned integer IDs. Starting with 0 means "no buffer" - it's like a null pointer.

```cpp
glGenBuffers(1, &bufferObject);
```
This asks OpenGL to generate 1 new buffer object name/ID and store it in `bufferObject`. After this call, `bufferObject` will contain a unique positive integer that represents your buffer in OpenGL's internal tables. The buffer exists as an ID but has no memory allocated yet.

```cpp
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, bufferObject);
```
This is where "binding" happens. **Binding means "make this buffer the currently active buffer for the specified target."** 

- `GL_ARRAY_BUFFER` is a binding target - it's like a slot where you plug in a buffer
- Think of it like inserting a USB drive into a USB port - the port is `GL_ARRAY_BUFFER`, the USB drive is your `bufferObject`
- Once bound, any buffer operations on the `GL_ARRAY_BUFFER` target will affect this specific buffer

```cpp
glBufferStorage(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, data.size(), data.data(), 0);
```
This allocates actual GPU memory for the buffer and uploads your data to it. It operates on whatever buffer is currently bound to `GL_ARRAY_BUFFER` (which is `bufferObject` from the previous line). The parameters are: target, size in bytes, pointer to data, and flags.

```cpp
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0);
```
This unbinds the buffer by binding buffer ID 0 (which means "no buffer") to the `GL_ARRAY_BUFFER` target. It's like unplugging the USB drive from the port. This is good practice to avoid accidentally modifying the buffer later.

**What binding accomplishes:** OpenGL is a state machine. Instead of passing buffer IDs to every function, you bind a buffer to a target, then all subsequent operations on that target affect the bound buffer. It's like saying "I'm working with this buffer now" rather than specifying it every time.
