## Overview

This episode explores why people often think they are being rational while emotions quietly influence what they notice, how they interpret events, and which options feel safe.

## Key Insights

- Emotions do not only interrupt thinking; they also prioritize information.
- Anxiety narrows focus toward threat cues and short-term certainty.
- Naming an emotion can reduce its intensity and improve judgment.

## Quotes

> "You cannot remove emotion from decision-making, but you can work with it."

## Reflections

I realized that most "bad decisions" in my week happened during cognitive overload rather than lack of knowledge. I want to build short emotional check-ins before high-stakes tasks.

## Takeaways

- Pause and label the dominant emotion before deciding.
- For important choices, separate idea generation from final commitment.
- Use a second review window when emotional intensity is high.
